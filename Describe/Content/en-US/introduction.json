Each part of the system is  developed separately. It makes development, troubleshooting and upgrade much easier. Using that method, we can also easily combine multiple languages together to make up a program or system. The downside though is that it's not a one file program. So if coded poorly, losing one file could cause a disaster or even crash the whole system. (Although, that's true with just about any program/system.)"

Here's the things I want to point out. If you visit this page without a JavaScript, you'll see an error message. That's about all the HTML code I got on this webpage. Normally, a webpage/site's interface is coded in HTML and CSS. But since I wanted to be able to change the contents at will (plus the multilanguage feature), I got a little creative. And I wanted that routing feature React.js got. It took me quite a while to learn it in Vanilla JS, so didn't want to waste it."
